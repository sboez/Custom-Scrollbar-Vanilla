### Problem :thinking:

I needed to have a CSS images gallery with a personalized cursor/scrollbar. The scrollbar is automaticaly asigned when you have an overflow but not really customizable.

### Solution :nerd_face:

I developed a _fake cursor/scrollbar_ from scratch with CSS and JS and added transparence to the native scrollbar. It's also possible to drag.

Here it's a simple border with an arrow icon but you can custom as you want, the script keep the same.
